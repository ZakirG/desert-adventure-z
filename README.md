This project was bootstrapped with [https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app](Create React App).

# Desert Survival Adventure

This project will be a webgame built with React Hooks, TypeScript, and React Spring.
The sprites in this game will be free sprites from the internet.

#### Instructions:

- Use the left and right arrow keys to run
- Jump and double-jump with the spacebar

#### Why build a game in React / TypeScript?

My learning goals are to master this stack, but aside from that:

- A game is an open-ended project that can be expanded indefinitely
- Games have complex state management requirements, which React and its libraries are useful for
- In the future, the project can be translated into React Native and rebuilt for iOS
- Games are fun, and fun makes learning easy ~
