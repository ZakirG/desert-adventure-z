This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Desert Survival Adventure

This project will be a webgame built with React Hooks, TypeScript, and React Spring.
The sprites in this game will be free sprites from the internet.

Why build a game in React / TypeScript?

- My learning goals are to master React + TypeScript
- A game is an open-ended project that can be expanded indefinitely
- Games have complex state management requirements
- In the future, the project can be translated into React Native and rebuilt for iOS
- Games are fun, and fun makes learning easy ~
